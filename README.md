# BicycleKaraoke

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdicke2s/BicycleKaraoke.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdicke2s/BicycleKaraoke)
**Project status : in development** 

=================================


Goal of this project is to develop a Karaoke machine as a challenging game for a station at http://ironscout.de/. The user will ride on a (fix mounted) bicycle and he is supposed to adjust riding speed, since music and lyrics playback will only work correctly if the user hits a specified range of rotational frequencies.

This repository holds an Android application which includes:
- Measurement of rotation frequency
- Video playback
- Audio playback
- User preferences
